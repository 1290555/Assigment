    <p>About Us
At Saylani Welfare Trust, we are committed to serving humanity with sincerity and dedication. Every day, our team works to provide free meals, medical care, education, and vocational training to those who need it most. For us, this is not just charity—it is a mission to bring ease and dignity to people’s lives. With the support of our volunteers and donors, we continue to expand our services so that no one goes hungry, no child is left without education, and every person has hope for a better future.</p>
